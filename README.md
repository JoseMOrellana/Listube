# LisTube

Listube is a website where you can create youtube playlists

## What i used/implemented

-   Flask
-   Google Oauth
-   Youtube Data Api

## Usage

You will need to create credentials in order to use google oauth and youtube data api. I followed [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5) tutorials to do so.

The app is not verified yet, so you will not be able to test it with your google account. I created an empty account: testinglistube@gmail.com - testing1298
